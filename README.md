## Run online

Run this notebook talk online, interactively on mybinder.org:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aoeftiger/TUDa-NMAP-03/v1.02)

or on the [local TU Darmstadt jupyterhub](https://tu-jupyter-i.ca.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/) using your TU ID. Make sure you install all the required packages by running in a terminal or (preceded by an exclamation mark !) in an empty jupyter notebook cell:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements_noversions.txt --prefix=`pwd`/requirements
``` 

## Run locally

The notebook can of course also be run on your local computer using your own jupyter notebook server. Install such an environment e.g. via the extensive [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), the minimalistic [Miniconda distribution](https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html) or the extremely fast [Mamba package manager](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). (The order indicates preference by simplicity in installation and usage.)

You may find all required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.
